# MileageExpenses
A Python desktop app for calculating mileage expenses for submission to your company or accounts.

On a successful configuration and run the app will calculate your mileage expenses, output the data to a CSV and or an Excel spreadsheet, backup and send your data via email and file attachments. All aspects of the app are pre configurable reducing user input and repetative configuration. The only data that requires input on a regular basis is your mileage data, your initial start mileage for each run and the month end date.
